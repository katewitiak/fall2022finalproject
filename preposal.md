# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm at a loss for what to do because I'm having a hard time gauging the extent of my abilities as well as how difficult it might be to execute certain ideas. For this reason I think I will just try to expand upon one of the game projects outlined in module 11 on Canvas (probably Mario). 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'm working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope
