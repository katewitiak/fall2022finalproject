# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Bootleg Geometry Dash

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game with the same concept as Geometry Dash.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a Geometry-Dash-style game in which the player will use the space bar (probably) to make their character avoid obstacles on a perpetually moving plane. The game will begin with a loading screen and level selection. If the player fails (their character hits an obstacle), the game ends and the user is asked whether they would like to play again. The player's score will be positively correlated with the amount of time they survive the level.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game functions (starting screen, game runs smoothly, should run until player fails, then after failure player is asked if they want to start a new game)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game functions, there's level selection (harder level = more frequent obstacles, potentially faster starting speed)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game functions, there's level selection (harder level = more frequent obstacles, potentially faster starting speed), character customization (color, potentially more?)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to complete the game track of the Harvard CS50 course to learn about game implementation. I will need to implement scrolling, enable user interaction, add background music, etc. to complete my game, all of which are features described in the Mario assignment on the course.
