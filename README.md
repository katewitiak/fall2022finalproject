# fall2022finalproject

I mostly achieved what I wanted to with this project, but it was still way more difficult than I imagined it would be to create a simple game. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to make the obstacles appear at random intervals rather than in uniform timed intervals to make the game more challenging, but I just couldn't get it to work. Couldn't figure out ground checks either. I think adding a score counter and a starting screen might have made this game better, but I am at least pleased with the general mechanics.
