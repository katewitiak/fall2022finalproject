Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created 2D project in Unity, watched/read tutorials on scripting in C#/adding physics in Unity, tried (and failed) several methods of making the objects in the game interact the way I want them to (player/ball should glide forward while also jumping to avoid obstacles when the player presses the space bar, should also bring player back to the beginning if they fail to avoid an obstacle). All of the necessary objects are in the game and the player can glide across a surface/react to the obstacles, but that reaction doesn't include making the player start over yet. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Haven't tried to add a starting screen, background music, or some sort of way to win the game because I'm still trying to make some of the basic mechanics work. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Scripting with C# feels like a huge learning curve and it's still pretty confusing for me. Unity keeps saying "All compiler errors have to be fixed before you can enter playmode!" but since I'm not used to C# and there seem to be so many versions of Unity I'm having a hard time finding out what my errors are. The other day I found out about Safe Mode which is really helpful when trying to identify errors, and since discovering that I think I've been making progress way more efficiently.
